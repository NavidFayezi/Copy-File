# copyy
This is my costume implementation of the linux `cp` command. Nothing really
fancy here, just practicing along the "The linux programming interface" book.  

## Compile and run
Complie the source code by running make. Then you may run:  
```$./copyy source destination```  
This copies the content of your `source` to the `destination`.  

This program is intended to copy **one** source to **one** destination.
